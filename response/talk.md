# Following up with a reported person

Once you've determined the action you should take to a incident report,
you may need to follow up with the person who was reported.
The most common action is to issue a verbal or written warning.
It’s never an easy conversation to have and it’s always good to be prepared for it.

## Who

Ideally, there should be two members of the Response Team giving a warning.
If Response Team member has a conflict of interest, they should exclude
themselves from the conversation.

## Where

Make sure to give a warning in a private space, ideally an empty room.
An organizer's room or conference swag room is a good place for that.
If the conference has a dedicated "quiet room" for attendees to have a quiet space, do not use that, as your discussion will disturb the users of the quiet room and not protect the privacy of the reported person.

## Before the talk

Have a discussion with people who are going to have this conversation, and make sure you're
on the same side when it comes to:

- What are you going to say
- Who from your team is going to start and lead the conversation
- What is the decision you made regarding sanctions

## Contacting the reported person

The first step is to ask the reported person to meet and speak with you in a private space.

For smaller events, it's easy to find the reported person.
For larger events, this may be harder.
In order to help you be able to contact a reported person, your registration for your event should collect names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
Collecting company names is also useful to help fully identify a reported person, since people will often talk about their employer in conversation, but not give their last name.

If responding to the incident is not time-critical, your first option is to email the reported person.
In the email, you should tell them that an organizer wants to speak to them about an urgent situation, and they should report to the organizer's room as soon as possible.
Many people ignore email during an event, or may wait until the end of the day or the end of the event to come find an organizer.
Be prepared with one team member who can stay in the organizer room and wait for the person.

If they do not contact you within a day, your next option is to call them and ask them to come to the organizer's room.

You can also alert the other organizers to be on the look out for the reported person.
They can keep the person in sight while calling you.

Sometimes an incident requires an immediate response, because attendee safety is in jeopardy.
In this case, it's important to find the reported person immediately.
When searching through a very large event for a person, reading the name on every badge is impossible.
You may need to search online to find a picture of the reported person.
Organizers can request other incident responders be on the look out for the person (and optionally attach the picture).
If necessary, you can ask venue security to pull video tapes of the event.
Venue security may also be necessary to help you find and talk to the reported person.

## Guidance on wording

1. Be calm, firm and in control.

2. Don’t go into too much detail, if possible, you shouldn’t make the reported person aware
 of who reported the incident. This is not always possible, but encouraged.

3. Describe that you’ve been made aware of *details of the situation* and tell them
 how this is in violation of the Code of Conduct.

4. Given the situation, inform them that the conference staff decided to take a following action,
and describe clearly what’s expected of the person you’re speaking to. Never encourage them
or expect apologies: this is up to them.

5. Pause to let them react, and then acknowledge their input. Do not get involved
 into discussion on who is right or not.

6. Make sure they know that they should don’t get involved into conversation with the
 reporter or try to apologize. If necessary, you can accept their apology and offer to
 relay it to the reporter (but you are not obligated to do so if you think it will re-harm them.)

## Escalaction

You're going to approach the conversation by:

1. Describing the person's behavior.
2. Describing the impact that behavior had on the reporter (without naming them). It's important to separate out behavior from impact (see Non-violent communication practices).
3. Allow them to respond to your description.
4. Calling them in, saying, "I need your help to make this a welcoming/safe/inclusive event by..."
5. Give them a behavioral modification plan.

It does sometimes happen that things do not go well, and the the
reported person starts an argument, and doesn't accept your behavioral modification plan.

You shouldn't make another decision on spot, during the conversation. Acknowledge
their behaviour, and inform them that you're going to get in touch with them to
communicate your final decision about how to handle this situation.

Do not get involved into the argument: repeat what impact they had on the reported person,
make it clear that their behavior needs to change
(despite any good intentions or excuses they had),
but to not try to get involved into a long discussion.

Now it's a time to re-evaluate the decision, so we recommend you to go back to the
second step of "Response" chapter: Team meeting, and discuss with your team if you
want to amend the decision due to lack of common understanding.

## What's next?

After the talk, it's important to meet back with your Response Team, tell them
how the conversation went, and make sure you're all on the same page that the
conversation had a successful outcome.

Then, it's time to [wrap up the incident]().
