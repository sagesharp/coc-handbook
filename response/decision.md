# Decision & sanctions

Many of Code of Conduct issues you're going to deal with will be minor incidents, and the goal is
to achieve common understanding with all involved parties. However, no matter
how minor or major your incident is, you need to make sure to react quickly and decide on the steps as soon as possible.

In our process, we usually make assumptions about possible outcome before even
going to meet the reported person. In case of minor incidents, if the talk goes well, and they see their mistake, a
 warning is usually enough. If a slide violated Code of Conduct, we will make sure
 it's removed from published version of the talk, is the tweet was offending, we ask author to remove it, so on and so on.

However, your decision may change if during the talk it will be clear that
the reported person indeed meant harm, or just "did not care". In this case, you should not
make a decision on spot, but meet with your Response Team to decide a new sanction
after "the talk". 

The possible sanctions might be different if the reported person feels sorry for their actions
or if they are defensive and angry about the report. It may also depend on whether their
actions were deliberate or they intended no harm.

Most Code of Conduct incidents reach a common understanding, and giving people a warning
to allow them to correct their actions in the future is the best solution in the situation. 

In case the reported person poses a threat to other attendees or organizers of the event, Response Team 
could take more extreme steps to ensure safety of everyone at the event.

## Possible sanctions

Your guiding principle should be the safety of your community members from harassment
and inappropriate behavior that makes them feel unwelcome or unsafe.
You should evaluate sanctions in light of whether they provide the safety needed.
You and your event are the only people who can judge appropriate sanctions in your
community based on the nature of the incident and the responses of the people involved,
but some possibilities are:

- warning the reported person to cease their behaviour and that any further reports will result in sanctions
- requiring that the reported person avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, the reporter for the remainder of the event
- ending a talk that violates the policy early
- not publishing the video or particular slide of a talk that violated the policy
- not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at this conference events
- immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the reported person holds
- requiring that the reported person not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- requiring that the reported person refund any travel grants and similar they received (this would need to be a condition of the grant at the time of being awarded)
- requiring that the reported person immediately leave the event and not return
- banning the reported person from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- removing a reported person from membership of relevant organizations
- [publishing an account of the incident](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Name_and_shame) and calling for the resignation of the reported person from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the reported person is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful)

### Employer reports
If a reported person instigated an incident while they were in an official employee capacity, such as while working as paid event staff, while giving a talk about their employer's product, while staffing a sponsor booth, while wearing their employer's branded merchandise, while attempting to recruit someone for a job, or while claiming to represent their employer's views, it may be appropriate to provide a short report of their conduct to their employer.

### Don't require or encourage apologies
We do not suggest asking for an apology to the reporter. You have no responsibility to enforce friendship, reconciliation, or anything beyond lack of inappropriate behavior between any two given attendees, and in fact doing so can contribute to someone's lack of safety at your event.
Forcing the reporter to acknowledge an apology from the reported person forces further uncomfortable contact, and puts more importance on the reported person's need to feel better about what they did over the reporter's need to feel safe.
It also creates a social expectation that the reporter will accept the apology, forgive the reported person, and return their social connection to its previous status.

If the reported person offers to apologize to the reporter (especially in person), we suggest strongly discouraging it. If a staff member relays an apology to the reporter, it should be brief and not require a response. ("X apologizes and agrees to have no further contact with you" is brief. "X is very sorry that their attempts to woo you were not received in the manner that was intended and will try to do better next time, they're really really sorry and hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive them" is emphatically not.)

If the reported person attempts to press an apology on someone who would clearly prefer to avoid them, or attempts to recruit others to relay messages on their behalf, this may constitute an additional violation of the Code of Conduct.
