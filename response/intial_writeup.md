# Write up internal report

It's very useful to start writing internal report as soon as possible, even before
taking any action or talking to anyone else outside your Response Team.

Unless the time sensitive reaction is needed and you don't have time to
write everything down immediately, we recommend writing down report on the spot.

Taking the time to write down all the details as clearly as possible, will allow you
to catch all the little things you wouldn't otherwise thought of before jumping
to conclusions. Writing your thoughts down is really valuable, and we've been
proved over and over again that this process lets you see things that otherwise
go unseen.

It will help you:

- look at the incident objectively and in more organized way,
- make your final report more accurate, as you won't get a chance
to forget any details - this is especially important if the incident was
reported verbally,
- prepare yourself to the possible talk with the involved sides,
- compare the incident with previous ones you dealt,
- make sure that all Code of Conduct team actions are described and
documented.

Make sure to document things as soon as they happen. Add description of
the talks with each involved sides after you come back from the meeting,
document when and who did what. Don't rely on your memory and don't leave
it for later, especially that after the event it will be much harder
to meet with the whole Code of Conduct team to finish the report.

## Content

The internal report should contain following information (but should not be limited
to only that):

* who, when, where, how the incident was reported?
* who received the report - it's especially important in case of verbal reports;
* when and where the reported incident happened
* who was involved?
* description of the received report: what happened? - make sure to state clearly
what impact the reported person's behavior had on the reporter,
* describe any planned actions taken:
    - if you decide to speak with involved sides, document who will meet and talk to them,
    - write down reactions of the involved sides on your Code of Conduct process -
does the reported person feels sorry? Or do they cause further problems?
    - document if you send any e-mails or ask any third parties for input and why,
* describe any decisions about further actions:
    - does the situation will be reported to anyone?
    - does the conference organizers or Code of Conduct team need to do anything?
* if the reported person is causing problems during the Code of Conduct process
make sure to document it too. Copy e-mails or make screenshots whenever applicable.

## Example report

**Report:** Verbal report made by *Person A* and received by *Response Team Member A*
 on 29th December 2000, 9am in the conference venue.
**When:** 28th December 2000, 10.30pm
**Where:** Conference party at Django* conference

**What happened:**
*Person A* overheard one of our attendees (later identified as *Person B*) speaking
 to his friends and saying something along the lines of "*Here is a quote*". The
 reporter went to this person and quietly asked them to tone it down.
 They got very confrontational (not physically) and insisted that it wasn't actually
 inappropriate. It was reminded him that our CoC applies but that didn't really stop them.

The conference staff decided to talk to this person the next day to try to achieve
common understanding of expected behaviour during the conference, or give a warning
if understanding is not achieved.

So on *Next day*, *Response Team Member A and B* took him aside to an empty room
and went over what happened, explaining our stance on the issue and the reason why we don't accept it.
The reported person immediately apologized on their own (without any prompt from us).
They said that after thinking on it, they realized fully how their behavior was
 wrong and they thanked us for stepping in. The whole meeting lasted about 10 minutes,
  was very calm and overall successful.

The conference staff decided not to take any further action and consider the case closed.

**Actions taken:**
- Response Team decided to talk to *Person B*, and during this meeting a common
understanding between Response Team and *Person B* was achieved.
- Issue will be included in conference's Transparency report after the event.
- This report will be sent to Django Software Foundation Code of Conduct in case
similar event occur in the future.
